# Trivter
Trivia Twitter. A project that posts Trivia about birds generated from GPT-3's API in the same way Twitter feeds are shown.

Currently the idea is to use a React.js framework to generate the tweets and do the API calls from GPT-3 and have them periodically posted onto the webpage.

..not sure why I chose Trivia about birds, but if you think about it long enough the bad puns start taking up space in your head.

GPT-3 API: https://openai.com/api/ <- Requires an account
